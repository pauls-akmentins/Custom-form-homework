# To run the app:

- npm run start

# The app includes 2 versions - Form V1 and Form V2

- Form V1 is a version with out of the box solution, where currently its visible, that the dropdown input could
- not have been matched between form layout data (/form) and form context data (/fields)

- Form V2 is a version with a workaround for the slight typo in API response, thus showing the dropdown field
